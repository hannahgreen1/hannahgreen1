### Hello, I am Hannah! 

I am from and living in Edinburgh, Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 but did have a brief stint living in London. 
I'm currently an Instructor teaching on our Professional Software Develepment course at CodeClan 💻 where we teach Python, Java and JavaScript. I am also very involved with marking our Profesional Devlopment Award with the SQA. 

I took the course myself in 2018 and then worked as a QA for a while before coming back to be part of the Instructor team. I am looking to learn more about Django and React Native 

I previously worked as a Medical Photographer 📸 for the NHS which was a fascinating and crazy role! 
I love to socialise and get out the house to explore and have adventures 🎿 🏉 ! 

You can reach me on twitter and instagram @hannnahgreeen ✌🏻 at anytime! Always happy to connect
